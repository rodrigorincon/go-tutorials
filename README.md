Some beggining codes in go to learn the language

### How to install
On Ubuntu, go to the terminal and run `sudo apt-get install golang-go`

To test is everything works, run the command `go version` and see if it returns the downloaded version.

### Running the codes
Enter in the folder where is the file you want to run and execute `go run myfile.go`. This command is good for testing, but take a time to run because it needs to compile before run. When you finish the code, run `go build myfile.go` to compile and create a binary file. To run the binary run `./myfile`
